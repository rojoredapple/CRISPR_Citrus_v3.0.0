Things I'd like to edit:

- Landing page navbar remove opacity, make contact button font the same
- Landing page search bar, slightly bigger (50% maybe)
- gene_table.html navbar search bar slightly to the right but still look good on mobile. Maybe not get folded into hamburger on mobile?
- gene_table.html table search bar not working - might be gulp issue?
- gene_table.html navbar logo change colour of SVG - svg tag?
- gene_page_template.html gap between "Location:" and data 
- gene_page_template.html orthogroup boxes not the same, flexbox issue 
- plant page_template.html sibling plants title box needs to be slightly bigger
- plant page_template.html Phenotyping Infomation box needs to be extended down over two rows
- Contact_form.html Edit "Reason for contact" style to match other titles
- Contact_form.html Add a "message" title to the text area
